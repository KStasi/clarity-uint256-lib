This project is meant to be used as a library for uint256.
Many blockchain-related services use bigint math meanwhile Clarity only supports uint up to 128-bits long.

# Usage

There are two approaches to use the lib:

- insert private functions directly into your code that can cause a mess and elarge code;
- call functions of the deployed lib.
